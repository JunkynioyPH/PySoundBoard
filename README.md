# PySoundBoard
Soundboard written in python as a hobby project.

I've always wanted a soundboard but I can't find one that is free to use.
So I made my own! Lmao.

I have 2 Versions. PySoundBoard_Legacy (TkInter/PyQt6_PyG) and PySoundboard_PyQt6.

PySoundboard_Legacy holds the old versions of the soundboard. Written with TkInter + PyGame. It also has a PyQt6 GUI which still uses PyGame

PySoundboard_PyQt6 is my latest iteration of this soundboard. Written soley with PyQt6.

# Pre-Requisites (PySoundboard_PyQt6)

# Basic TL;DR; to make the soundboard to work
When you run **PySoundBoard_\*.py**, it will give a **1-time pop** up and create **Settings.json**
In **Settings.json**, you can set **AudioDevice** to your preferred output device.
