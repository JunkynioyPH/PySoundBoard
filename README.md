# PySoundBoard
Soundboard written in python as a hobby project.

I've always wanted a soundboard but I cant find one that is free to use.
So I made my own! Lmao.

Please refer to the issues tab if any issues, duh.

This is the default way of making this soundboard to work and it requires multiple things to be installed.

# Basic TL;DR; to make the soundboard to work
When you run **PySoundBoard_\*.py**, it will give a **1-time pop** up and create **Settings.json**
In **Settings.json**, you can set **AudioDevice** to your preferred output device.
