# PySoundBoard
Soundboard written in python as a hobby project.

I've always wanted a soundboard but I cant find one that is free to use.
So I made my own! Lmao.

Please refer to the issues tab if any issues, duh.
# Pre-Requisites
**(Python 3.10+** ~~& make sure you have Ttk/TKinter Ticked!~~**)**
Requires **python** to be installed.

~~(pip install ttkthemes) OPTIONAL~~
~~Requires ttkthemes to be installed for DarkMode.~~

SoundBoard is now written on **PyQt6** Poggers!

**(pip install pygame)**
Requires **pygame** to be installed.

This is the default way of making this soundboard to work and it requires multiple things to be installed.

# Basic TL;DR; to make the soundboard to work (for advanced people)
When you run **PySoundBoard_PyQt6.py**, it will give a 1-time pop up and create **Settings.json**
In **Settings.json**, set **AudioDevice** to your preferred output device.

# Setup to make the soundboard WORK
Instructions to be made available... at some point.. lmao

# Fingers Crossed
Hope that everything works as it should!
